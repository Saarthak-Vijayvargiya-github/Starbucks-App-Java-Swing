# StarBucks Vending Machine App

This project provides a basic illustration of a Vending Machine App, fully developed in Java, which serves as an outcome of the CS F213 Object-Oriented Programming course taught at BITS Pilani, Rajasthan. The app was fully developed using Java Swing and primarily emphasized the [Decorator](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/decorator-design-pattern-in-java-with-example/) design pattern."

## Why we made this?

The main intention behind this project was to provide a simple yet functional use case of the decorator pattern in real-world applications. It is designed to be easily understood while showcasing the power of the <em>Decorator</em> design pattern. Additionally, the project adheres to the Single Responsibility Principle [SRP] and the Open/Closed Principle [OCP] effectively.

## Caution

The project may show errors regarding javax library as the javax is removed from the current versions of the JRE System Library [JavaSE-20]. To correct it, just import older versions of JRE (JavaSE-1.6 used here).
